# Abstract
The rise of cloud architecture and smart manufacturing has prompted many small and medium-sized manufacturing industries to shift from on-premises architecture to cloud architecture. For instance, infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) or software as a service (SaaS) are in the domain of cloud architecture.\
Even though cloud architecture has a lot of advantages, like reducing the cost of hardware, IT and deployment time, besides increasing flexibility as well. However, it still must face the information security problems, such as the cloud service provider security and the network transmission security. Therefore, the performance and security of the secure channel were analyzed in this research, when transiting from on-premises architecture to cloud architecture for small and medium-sized manufacturing industries.\
Based on IaaS architecture, the site-to-site secure channel (IPsec) from the factory router to the cloud service was built, where AES128 was used as the symmetric encryption algorithm and SHA1 was used as the hash function. Finally, the throughput and latency of site-to-site and end-to-end network were respectively analyzed in this research, and used opensource software Wireshark to capture the packet to verify the security of the secure channel.\
